# About me
I'm a firmware engineer from Vietnam with experience working with various microcontroller units (MCUs) such as STM32, AVR, C2000, both in bare-metal and real-time operating system (RTOS) environments. 
- I enjoy working with motors (like DC motor, stepper motor), lithium batteries, and have knowledge about switching power.
- I also have experience working with embedded Linux systems.
